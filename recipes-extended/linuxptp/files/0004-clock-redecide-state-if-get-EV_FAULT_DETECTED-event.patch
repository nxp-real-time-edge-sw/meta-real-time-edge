Subject: [PATCH 04/23] clock: redecide state if get EV_FAULT_DETECTED event

IEEE 802.1AS-2011's methodology for faults is to avoid waiting
in that FAULTY state in hopes that management will notice.
Instead, move on to search for a valid non-faulty state. If
supported, the fault is logged so that management can notice
later, but that logging isn't a requirement.

This patch is to invoke BMCA to redecide state if get
EV_FAULT_DETECTED event.
